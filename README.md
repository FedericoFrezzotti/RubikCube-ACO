# RubikCube-ACO
Bachelor’s thesis project implementing the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Rubik’s Cube. The study highlights how intelligent search techniques can discover new solving strategies beyond traditional Monte Carlo and rational approaches, demonstrating the potential of bio-inspired computation in complex problem solving.
